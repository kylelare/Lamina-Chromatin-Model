# Lamina-Chromatin-Model
This repository contains all of the files associated with the Lamina-Chromatin Model I developed with Dr. Sumitabha Brahmachari at Rice University.

I am still cleaning up and assembling all of the files that will be uploaded here so this repository is currently a work in progress.
